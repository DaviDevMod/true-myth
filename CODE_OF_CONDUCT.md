# Code of Conduct

Everyone is welcome to interact with and contribute to this project. No harassing people for *any* reason. Be kind in your interactions. Assume the best intentions from others in your interactions. Be patient (this is no one’s full-time job).

If there’s a problem—including with the maintainers themselves—contact [Chris Krycho](mailto:hello@chriskrycho.com) or [Ben Makuh](mailto:ben.makuh@gmail.com) directly and we’ll get it sorted out as quickly as we are able.
